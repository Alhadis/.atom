# Atom Phoenix-Syntax

I'm absolutely loving Atom. As I make the gradual switch from Aptana and Text Wrangler towards GitHub's slick, sexy editor,
I find myself unable to abandon my old coding habits. Being used to an extremely particular workflow for many years is a
rather difficult thing to shake off, so I decided to preserve all the code-colours and keyboard shortcuts I'm familiar with
in the form of a public repository. That way it's in the cloud, and I'll never have to keep zipped folders of INI files
hidden in some remote hard-drive folder ever again.
