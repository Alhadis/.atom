# Atom Phoenix-Syntax

Personal theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/), an editor I'll use until I die.

There's nothing here that's of use or value to you. Trust me.
This is hosted on GitHub so if my computer carks it, I'll still have my personal workflow and setup available in the cloud.


“Uh, why the hell is this a syntax th-…”
----------------------------------------

Because literally the very first thing I learned to do in Atom was customise the code colours.
I'd made a very sudden switch to Atom from years of using Aptana, and in the middle of pressing deadlines.
I didn't have time to figure out how Atom was properly customised, so I took the hackiest, most direct route possible.
Workloads didn't slow down as the year raged past: quite the opposite.
Knowledge of Atom was slow under heavy-hitting workloads and personal battles fought on the side,
and organising my customisations really didn't come to mind.

Eventually, this became the axis of my workflow, and I'm now too damn used to it to switch.

Explanation added because I'd be asking myself the same bewildered question if I saw somebody else enclosing their Atom-hacks in a syntax-theme.
