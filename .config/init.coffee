# I love this program.

# Atom will evaluate this file each time a new window is opened. It is run
# after packages are loaded/activated and after the previous editor state
# has been restored.
#
# An example hack to log to the console when each text editor is saved.
#
# atom.workspace.observeTextEditors (editor) ->
#   editor.onDidSave ->
#     console.log "Saved! #{editor.getPath()}"


# Hide scope-related notices shortly after displaying them
atom.workspace.notificationManager.onDidAddNotification (popup) ->
	if /^\s*Scopes at Cursor/.test(popup.message)
		setTimeout (->
			popup.dismiss()
		), atom.config.get("popupDismissDelay") || 1000
